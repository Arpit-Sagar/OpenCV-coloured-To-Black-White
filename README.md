# OpenCV-Coloured-To-Black-White
In this Artificial Intelligence project, any video is taken as 
input from user and it is converted from coloured to black and 
white using python code with the help of OpenCV Library 
and the output shows a live window playing the black and 
white video.

Thus this project illustrates the use of OpenCv 
and corresponding functions.The simulations are done using 
Sublime Text code editor and Command Prompt for executing 
the python code .
